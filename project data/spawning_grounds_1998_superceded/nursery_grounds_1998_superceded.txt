    Abstract:
      Fisheries Sensitivity Maps in British Waters
      --------------------------------------------

      The layers in this file have now been superceded by layers described in the following report :

      Ellis, J.R., Milligan, S., Readdy, L., South, A., Taylor, N. and Brown, M. 2010. Mapping the spawning and nursery grounds of selected fish for spatial planning. Report to the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs from Cefas. Defra Contract No. MB5301

      The original nursery ground maps in this layer were compiled from data collected and collated by Fisheries Research Service, Aberdeen, and CEFAS Lowestoft, and form part of a comprehensive study financed by The Scottish Office and MAFF in 1998.

      Selected spawning and nursery grounds in the Irish Sea were updated in 2003 as part of the JNCC Irish Sea Pilot.
    Purpose: To provide an indication of the location of nursery grounds of selected marine commercial fish species within British waters.

      For continuity, some spawning and nursery grounds have been mapped beyond UK waters.
