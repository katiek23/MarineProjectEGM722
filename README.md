** EGM722 Python Coding Project: Cetacean sightings around the Irish Coast **

Casual cetacan sightings data provided by the Irish Whale and Dolphin group (IWDG).
Step 1: creates a map with locations of sightings
Step 2: provides insight into Marine Protected Areas and Fishing activity in the area

This project aims to explore and plot cetacean (whale, dolphin, porpoise) sightings around the Irish Coast. Further, 
comparison to fishing activity can help determine whether an overlap in their distribution exists and whether this could have 
negative consequences for population health.

Thank you to the IWDG who kindly sent me this data. Their website can be found at [Irish Whale and Dolphin Group] (https://iwdg.ie)
